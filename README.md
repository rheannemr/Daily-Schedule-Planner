# Daily-Schedule-Planner
This is a simple daily planner application that displays the hours of a single work day (9AM - 5PM) with the user's current time (using moment.js library). The user is able to enter notes into the textarea field and when hitting the 'Save' button, their notes are then saved to local storage by the hour. The past hours turn gray, the present/current hour will appear red, and all future hours of the day will appear green.
